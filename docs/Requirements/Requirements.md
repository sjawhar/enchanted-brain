## Concert
### Overall
* 750 audience members
* During registration, we will collect the age and sex of each user. We will also ask each user "to what extent, if any, do you have difficulty in telling colors apart that other people are easily able to tell apart":
    * 0 = "No Difficulty at all"
    * 1 = "Slight or Infrequent Difficulty" 
    * 2 = "Moderate Difficulty"
    * 3 = "Definite or Frequent Difficulty"
* During the concert, the app will move from one section to the next (e.g. mental imagery, color/emotion, etc.) without requiring the user to navigate through the app.
* At intermission, each audience member's app will thank the user for participating and signal the end of the part of the concert which uses the app.
